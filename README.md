# project_github
pre course project

With the data from the website Barcelona's open data service (http://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/en)
will analyse the evolution of the prices of the average rent, average rent per m2, number of rental agreements
and average area, since 2014 until the first trimestre of 2017.

The objective is to use matplotlib (or other library) to create a graphic that shows the evolution of the rents
throughout the years.
ex:
https://matplotlib.org/_images/date_demo.png

and compare between several barrios like for ex:

form the blog http://blog.journeyofanalytics.com/top-us-cities-with-highest-rent/



Will also try to compare the current prices of different barrios using a library yet to be decided.
The objective is to create a visualization like for example:
